This script is from Denise Worthen.  To run you do: 

ncl plot_ww3tripole.ncl

If you do:
  wkstype="X11"
  ;wkstype="png"

instead of
  ;wkstype="X11"
  wkstype="png"
it will go to a window instead of the png file. 

the rtsrc  is the path to your folder

and here is where you put the name of the file in:
   gf =addfile(rtsrc+"ww3.194801.nc","r")


   lstep=15-1     is the time step (it indexes starting with zero so that's why there is the -1).
