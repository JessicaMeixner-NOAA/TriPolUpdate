Description of cases that can be run as regression tests using run_test script 
Currently need to add in run_test to copy the ocean_hgrid.nc into the current work directory 

To run the tests: 
./bin/run_test -b slurm -c Intel -i input2 -s PR1 -w work_serial -o netcdf ../model TriPol
./bin/run_test -b slurm -c Intel -s PR1_MPI -w work_MPI_test01 -o netcdf -f -p srun -n 12 ../model TriPol


input
- Is the original directory without modifications 

input2 
- Swell propagation case (currently going straight over N.Pole), Constant deep water depth (-1000m)
 
input3 
- Swell propagation case with actual bathymetry 

input4
- Wind input is added, uses actual bathy, source terms are added
